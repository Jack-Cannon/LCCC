# Overview
The LCCC (Liquid Chromatography at the Critical Condition, or LC3x for short) web project was developed by the Chemistry department at the University of Memphis. This project involves a cloud hosted database of research experiments from use of LCCC techniques to analyze complex mixtures and provide details information about their components. This doucment provides instructions on how to install and use the necessary software to run the web application on your local machine or hosting on a web server.
